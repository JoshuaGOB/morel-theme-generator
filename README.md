MOREL is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator to create Mobile, Open, Resilient, Electronic Libraries. MOREL takes simple bibliographic lists, runs them through the [Jekyll site generator](https://jekyllrb.com/), and creates a static website ready to be served for free by Github pages. MOREL sites can also be published through freemium deployment services such as Netlify, and through commercial or institutional servers. MOREL is perfect to create personal, project, or organization curated collections, using third party storage on services such as Archive.org.


## Philosophy

MOREL libraries are *open* because the code they use is under a GNU [license](), and the other services and technologies that it uses --Jekyll, [Internet Archive](https://github.com/jjjake/internetarchive) and [Zotero](https://github.com/zotero/zotero)-- are open too. Therefore, MOREL can be copied and improved by anyone who needs it, as long as credit is given to the original project and its openness is maintained.

They are *mobile* because their design is optimized for use on small devices such as tablets and phones, and likewise the downloadable files are adapted so that their weight can be handled by small devices.

And they are *resilient* because of their decentralized nature. On the one hand, the site’s code is not necesarily fixed on an institutional server, but on open code hosting services such as GitHub and GitLab. On the other hand, the collection of downloadable files is hosted on Archive.org, the site of a non-profit organization that has been dedicated to preserving Internet content since 1996. These conditions allow the repository to not depend on variable circumstances, such as the availability of a particular server or administrator, but the site can be reproduced for free in multiple instances.
